/**
 * Binary search is musch faster than linear search.
 * Different from linear search, binary search implements such a logic that it covers half of the data structure
 * and, based on the searched value, it can infer if it proceeds its search to its left or right. By doing this
 * it drastically reduces time.
 *
 * NOTICE, the iteratable data structure, i.e. an array, must be organized, sorted.
