/**
 * BubbleSort
 *
 * Trough every iteration two consecutive elements are compered.
 * If the second is evaluated as lesser than the first one,
 * those values are swaped.
 * Then, bigger values "bubble" to the top/end of the data structure.
 *
 * Notice: Bubble sort uses nested loops!
 *
 * Big O: can be O(nÂ²) but, if the analyzed data is nearly sorted, a short circuit
 * can prevent further unecessary iterations, roughly getting near to O(n).
 * This is, obviously, an ideal scenerio.
